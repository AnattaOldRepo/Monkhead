# Current htaccess rules also take care of disallowing .git folder and any other sensitive files such as .sql because basically it rewrites every call to index.php with the exception of git-pull.php which is necessary for receiving github pings

Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin *

# Different set of rules of git-pull.php, necessary for github pings

# If the access was for git-pull.php, its execution doesn't even reach this point

# For any other access attempts, these rules kick in.
# Reason why I have setup it like this is for performance reasons, rewrite to index.php for every access untill a separate rule is specified for that above. This way we have an extra check for specific file at each request and therotically it should be still faster because we are still avoiding any file existence checks.
